      <p>
        ðŸ‘‹ I'm Marcus, the creative mind behind RepRecall! What started as a
        side project during a gym sessions with my friend has blossomed into
        something extraordinary. As the app evolved, I recognized its potential
        and dedicated my time to refine RepRecall. Now I'm eager to share it
        with the world.
