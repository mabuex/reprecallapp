      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <h4>Last Updated: Mar 19, 2024</h4>
      <p>Thank you for using RepRecall!</p>
      <p>
        These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the RepRecall iOS
        app (the "<strong>App</strong>"). By using the App, you agree to comply
        with and be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms,
        please do not use the App.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
      <p>
        RepRecall is designed to respect your privacy, and as such, we do not
        collect any personal data from you. We do not access or store any
        information about your usage patterns, device information, or any other
        identifiable information.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Cloud Sync</h2>
      <p>
        RepRecall automatically syncs your data to your personal iCloud account.
        This process is entirely handled by Apple's iCloud infrastructure, and
        we do not have access to or store any of your files.
      </p>
      <h2>3. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes
        in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
        We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy
        Policy on our website or within the App.
      </p>
      <h2>4. Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>
        RepRecall Premium is available as a monthly or yearly subscription. It
        will automatically be renewed at the end of your subscription unless it
        is cancelled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the subscription
        period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any
        unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a
        subscription.
      </p>
